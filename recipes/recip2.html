      In a surprise to absolutely no one, spaghetti squash—unfairly maligned as
      bland and watery—tastes amazing when smothered in flavorful tomato sauce
      and blanketed under a layer of melty cheese. Here the tomato sauce cooks
      in the oven at the same time the squash roasts; combine the two, return
      the dish to the oven, and you’ve got a hands-off dinner with minimal
      cleanup. Serve this with bread and a green salad one night, then mix
      leftovers into pasta for “noodles” on noodles the next. Halving the squash
      crosswise is a tip we learned from cookbook writer and food blogger
      Alexandra Stafford; it involves easier (and safer!) knife work and results
      in longer, more noodle-like strands. The bake time of the squash depends
      on the squash itself—anecdotally and with no scientific backing, I’ve
      found that smaller, yellower spaghetti squashes tend to cook faster and
      taste better. —Sarah Jampel

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pound fresh, skinless snapper, bass, halibut, or other ocean fish
        fillets, cut into 1/2-inch dice
      </li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>1 medium white onion, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>
        2 medium-large tomatoes (about 1 pound), chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>
        Fresh hot green chiles (2 to 3 serranos or 1 to 2 jalapeños), stemmed,
        seeded, and finely chopped
      </li>
      <li>1/3 cup chopped cilantro, plus a few leaves for garnish</li>
      <li>
        1/3 cup chopped pitted green olives (manzanillos for a typical Mexican
        flavor)
      </li>
      <li>1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (optional) Kosher salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons fresh orange juice or 1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>

      <li>1 large or 2 small ripe avocados, peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
      <li>Tostadas, tortilla chips, or saltine crackers, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 425°. Line a rimmed baking sheet with a silicone baking mat
        or parchment paper. Place squash on baking sheet and drizzle with oil;
        rub to coat. Season with salt and black pepper. Turn cut side down and
        bake until a paring knife easily pierces skin and squash collapses
        easily under the pressure of tongs, 40–60 minutes, depending on your
        squash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place tomatoes in a 3-qt. baking dish (any shape, such as an
        oval or a 13x9" rectangle works!) and squish with your hands to break
        tomatoes apart. Add garlic, sugar, ¼ cup oil, ¼ tsp. crushed red pepper
        flakes, ¼ tsp. kosher salt, and season with black pepper; stir to
        combine. Bake, stirring once or twice, until sauce thickens slightly and
        is bright red and bubbly, 35–40 minutes. Using a rubber spatula or
        spoon, coarsely mash garlic and any tomato pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let squash cool slightly, then, using a fork, tease out flesh; discard
        skin. Add to baking dish with tomato sauce along with Parmesan. Stir to
        combine, breaking up squash further into strands. Season with salt and
        top with mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return baking dish to oven and bake squash until cheese is melted, 5–7
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat broiler. Broil, watching closely, until cheese is bubbly and
        browned, 1–2 minutes. Top with basil, more crushed red pepper flakes,
        and black pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
