      Here, expert on Mexican flavors Rick Bayless shows us how to make ceviche.
      His traditional ceviche recipe, a classic no-cook summer appetizer, works
      with any fresh fish fillet with mild flavor, like halibut or snapper. Be
      sure to pick up lots of limes to squeeze — you’ll need 1 1/2 cups to
      marinate the fish. Afterward, toss the “cooked” fish with plenty of
      tomatoes, onion, green chiles, olives, cilantro, and avocado for layers of
      freshness and flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 small spaghetti squash (about 2½ lb.), halved crosswise, seeds removed
      </li>
      <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
      <li>¼ tsp. kosher salt, plus more Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
      <li>4 large garlic cloves, smashed A big pinch of sugar</li>
      <li>¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>1½ oz. Parmesan, finely grated</li>
      <li>6 oz. mozzarella, coarsely grated</li>
      <li>1 handful of basil leaves, torn if large</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        In a 1 1/2-quart glass or stainless steel bowl, combine the fish, lime
        juice, and onion. Use enough juice to cover the fish and allow it to
        float freely; too little juice means unevenly "cooked" fish. Cover and
        refrigerate for about 4 hours, until a cube of fish no longer looks raw
        when broken open. Drain in a colander.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix together the tomatoes, green chiles, cilantro,
        olives, and optional olive oil. Stir in the fish and season with salt,
        usually about 1/2 teaspoon. Add the orange juice or sugar. Cover and
        refrigerate if not serving immediately.
      </li>
      <li>Just before serving, gently stir in the diced avocado.</li>
    </ol>
