    <p>
      Elote (pronounced eh-loh-tay) is Mexican street corn. If you’ve had it, I
      bet you love it. If you haven’t, you’re in for a treat! Elote tastes sweet
      and savory, tangy and spicy all at once. I love to make mine with grilled
      corn for some smokiness, too. Elote is made with corn on the cob,
      slathered with mayonnaise, seasoned with chili powder and fresh lime
      juice, sprinkled all over with salty Cotija cheese and cilantro. It’s
      messy to eat but worth every bite. Elote is the perfect summertime side
      dish for any Mexican-inspired meal.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Corn: The fresher, the better. In Mexico, you’ll find a wider variety of
        corn used for elotes. I’ve been making do with fresh sweet corn and have
        been quite pleased with the results. Grill the sweet corn, if you can,
        because the charred kernels seem closer in texture to the elotes I’ve
        bought in Mexico.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mayonnaise: Some elote recipes call for sour cream instead of
        mayonnaise, or a half-and-half mix of both. While I’m not the world’s
        biggest mayo fan, it was the clear winner in my taste tests. Mayonnaise
        seemed to amplify the other flavors, while sour cream seemed to dull
        them. If you’re interested in lightening up this side dish, however, you
        could use sour cream or even Greek yogurt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chili powder: If you have a special chili powder on hand (like ancho,
        guajillo or chipotle), elote is a great place for it to shine. Or you
        could use Tajín for some extra-tangy flavor (it’s a Mexican spice blend
        of chili powder and lime).
      </li>
      <li>
        Spice level: If you’re sensitive to spice, choose a mild chili powder
        blend, and omit the cayenne.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cotija cheese: You can find Cotija cheese at well-stocked grocery stores
        (I buy mine at Whole Foods, near the goat cheese) or Mexican grocers. If
        you can’t find Cotija cheese, feta or Parmesan would be your next best
        bets.
      </li>
      <li>Cilantro: If you don’t like cilantro, skip it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Grill your corn. You could steam or boil your corn cobs instead, but
        like I’ve said, I love the flavor of grilled corn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare your sauce and sprinklings. While the corn is cooking, you’ll
        mix together mayonnaise, lime juice, chili powder, optional cayenne (if
        you like heaand salt. In another bowl, mix together grated Cotija cheese
        and cilantro.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the corn with the mayo blend. This is where things start getting
        messy. If you don’t have a pastry brush, you could probably get by with
        a butter knife.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the Cotija and cilantro mixture all over. Place a plate under
        the corn to any cheese that doesn’t stick. You might need it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish it off with a sprinkle of chili powder. A final dusting of chili
        powder offers some much-needed color and a final boost of flavor. Enjoy!
